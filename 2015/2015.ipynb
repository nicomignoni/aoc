    "\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from `0` to `65535`). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: `x AND y -> z` means to connect wires `x` and `y` to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- `123 -> x` means that the signal `123` is provided to wire `x`.\n",
    "- `x AND y -> z` means that the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of wire `x` and wire `y` is provided to wire `z`.\n",
    "- `p LSHIFT 2 -> q` means that the value from wire p is [left-shifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift) by `2` and then provided to wire `q`.\n",
    "- `NOT e -> f` means that the [bitwise complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT) of the value from wire `e` is provided to wire `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible gates include OR ([bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR)) and RSHIFT ([right-shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift)). If, for some reason, you'd like to **emulate** the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators), or [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)) provide operators for these gates.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "123 -> x\n",
    "456 -> y\n",
    "x AND y -> d\n",
    "x OR y -> e\n",
    "x LSHIFT 2 -> f\n",
    "y RSHIFT 2 -> g\n",
    "NOT x -> h\n",
    "NOT y -> i\n",
    "```\n",

The registers are named `a` and `b`, can hold any [non-negative integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number), and begin with a value of `0`. The instructions are as follows:\n",
    "- `hlf r` sets register `r` to **half** its current value, then continues with the next instruction.\n",
    "- `tpl r` sets register `r` to **triple** its current value, then continues with the next instruction.\n",
    "- `inc r` **increments** register `r`, adding `1` to it, then continues with the next instruction.\n",
    "- `jmp offset` is a **jump**; it continues with the instruction offset away relative to itself.\n",
    "- `jie r`, offset is like `jmp`, but only jumps if register `r` is even (\"jump if **even**\").\n",
    "- `jio r`, offset is like `jmp`, but only jumps if register `r` is `1` (\"jump if **one**\", not odd).\n",
    "\n",
    "All three jump instructions work with an offset relative to that instruction. The offset is always written with a prefix + or - to indicate the direction of the jump (forward or backward, respectively). For example, jmp +1 would simply continue with the next instruction, while jmp +0 would continuously jump back to itself forever.\n",

The diagonal $k(x,c)$ belongs to is $d(r,c) = r+c-1$, where $d(1,1) = 1$ is the diagonal the first entry of the matrix belong to. Up to diagonal $d(r,c)$ there are $D = d(r,c)(d(r,c) + 1)/2$ numbers, where D is the $d(r,c)$-th triangular number. Also, $f(1,d(r,c)) = D$. At this point, ew need to descend along the $d(r,c)$-th diagonal from $(1,d(r,c))$ to $(r,c)$, i.e., we need to reduce $D$ up to $k(r,c)$, hence\n",
